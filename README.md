# AdminService

**The official documentation on the open source module 'AdminService,' the versatile, easy-to-work-with admin module for any and all Roblox developers to use!**

~~This website is very ugly right now. It will get better the more I learn how to use GitHub pages (and when I can learn how to use themes. Why did they have to take away the "Change Theme" button. It was so simple, now I have no idea what to do, the documentation is extremely unhelpful, and I can't find any videos online about it. Someone please help ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­)~~

### What is AdminService?

AdminService is an open source module meant to make admin commands easy!

---

### Setup
Most, if not every admin command module or "pack" requires no setup. With the way AdminService is designed, it unfortunately does, but it can be done in three lines.

Despite needing setup via another script, but as mentioned, only needs three lines; however, you need to insert the module before you can do anything else.

If you don't have the module, [get it here](https://create.roblox.com/marketplace/asset/14663644773/AdminService)

Then in Studio, you need the toolbox open if you don't already. Go to the `Home` tab at the very top, or the `View` tab, and click the `Toolbox` button in either tab.
Next, you have to insert the module by going to "My Models," which is the button that has four squares.

Here is an image pointing where you need to go:
