# AdminService

**The official documentation on the open source module 'AdminService.', the versatile, easy-to-work-in (and with) admin module for any and all Roblox developers to use!**

~~This website is very ugly right now. It will get better the more I learn how to use GitHub pages (and when I can learn how to use themes. Why did they have to take away the "Change Theme" button. It was so simple, now I have no idea what to do, the documentation is extremely unhelpful, and I can't find any videos online about it. Someone please help ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­)~~

### What is AdminService?

AdminService is an open source module meant to make admin commands easy!

Most, if not every admin command module or "pack" requires no setup. With the way AdminService is designed, it unfortunately does, but it can be done in three lines.

### The `_aux` module

`D.R.Y.`
One of the most basic and most important rules in programming. It stands for Don't Repeat Yourself
