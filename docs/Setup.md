# Setup

Most, if not every admin command module or system requires no setup. With the way AdminService is designed, it unfortunately does, but it's done in only three lines of code!

Despite needing setup via another script as already mentioned, it only takes three lines of code; however, you need to insert the module before you can do anything else.

If you don't have the module, [get it here](https://create.roblox.com/marketplace/asset/14663644773/AdminService).
