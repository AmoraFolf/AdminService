**The official documentation on the open source module 'AdminService,' the versatile, easy-to-work-with admin module for any and all Roblox developers to use!**

~~This website is very ugly right now. It will get better the more I learn how to use GitHub pages (and when I can learn how to use themes. Why did they have to take away the "Change Theme" button. It was so simple, now I have no idea what to do, the documentation is extremely unhelpful, and I can't find any videos online about it. Someone please help ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­)~~

### What is AdminService?

AdminService is an open source module meant to make admin commands easy!

With the module being open source, and its user-friendly work envrionment, you can easily add commands, even with very low level knowledge of Luau. Though, they may be basic and restrained by that.. but you will be able to do more the more you learn.
